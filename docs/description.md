# Overview

This block calculates differential clonotype abundance (DCA) between conditions using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) v1.46.0 with local fit. The block takes the output of MiXCR Clonotyping 2 block as input. It then generates DCA lists as outputs that can be used by other downstream blocks.
